Repository created with LinkedIn profile analysis project done.
The dataset was imported from my linkedin profile through the settings and so I chose some columns that I found more relevant.
The following columns were analyzed:

- Causes You Care
- Certifications
- Connections
- Endorsement Information Received
- Skills

A small treatment was done using Python and Pandas, and then a dashboard was created in Power BI for analysis.
The link to the dashboard is below:

## Libraries

The following libraries/packages need to be installed before running the project:
